# 👋🏼 Hi, I’m Kristin

I recently made a career switch to software engineering, and completed the intensive Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly in June 2023.

Before diving into tech, I spent several years working in various roles in marketing, merchandising, and sales. I realized that I wanted to pursue a career that allowed me to use my analytical and problem-solving skills in a more technical context.

I'm excited about the future of tech and the many opportunities it presents, and I'm eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to innovative projects and teams.
